## Idea

### Summary
Make a card game with Genshin Impact type wishing system with random anime series
Each card will have a rarity score, element, name, picture, category. 

### Rarity
Rarity of a card can be a 1 to 3 star and defines how a rare a card is to get through the gambling system (Insert name to be changed).

### Element
An element defines what kind of element catagory the card belongs to. 

### Name
Name.

### Picture
The visual cover art for a specific card.

### Category
Defines which series/anime the character is from.

## Planning
- I need to define first and formost what a card is and what attributes each card should have, the first idea is to make a class that each card inherits from. 
- A card will have the attributes Rarity, Name, Cover, Element, Category.
- I will need to make a currency which you earn through for example waiting, sitting in a voice channel or typing in chat. Which you use to spend on gambling system (Insert name to be changed).
- See if I can grab EXP from the XP bot.
- Make a trading system before Valorant does.

## Execution

- [ ] Implement discord syntax
- [ ] Implement card class and define what a card is
- [ ] Create gambling system (Insert name to be changed)
- [ ] Make a inventory system for each discord user
- [ ] Implement anime/series category 
- [ ] Make a reward system and also implement a currency system
